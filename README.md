# EZ-Pathfinding-V5
EZ Pathfinding V5 is a module based on the current code of the pro version. This will be the final version of EZ Pathfinding and in short my last contribution to roblox. This module strives as a pathfinding service wrapper with extra functionality. Compared to the other modules in the series, this is much simpler and more pleasing to the eyes. I hope this module provides some use to you.

# Why Choose This Module?
This module incorporates OOP and is effective at its job of being a pathfinding wrapper. This module not only makes pathfinding easier to use; it adds extra core functionality that will be useful. This module also is compatible with parts - not only rigs. The code is made in a neat and readable format. I believe this would make a great addition to your game.
